Objective: Reach a total score as close to 21 as possible without going over.
Deck: Use a 36-card deck consisting of ranks from 6 through Ace.
Card Values:
Cards from 6 to 9 are worth their face value.
Tens, Jacks, Queens, and Kings are each worth 10 points.
Aces 11 points
Gameplay: player starts with two cards dealt by the dealer.
Players take turns deciding whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep current total).
If a player's total exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose immediately.
Winning Conditions:
The player whose final score is closest to 21 without exceeding it wins.
If both players bust, the one who got closer to 21 wins.
If there's a tie at 21, it's considered a draw.
Additional Rules:
In some variations, an initial hand of 21 (e.g., an ace and a ten-valued card) is called a "blackjack" and may have special rules or payouts.
